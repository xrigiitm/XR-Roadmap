## Augmented Reality
AR enhances the real world by overlaying digital information onto it, offering interactive experiences through devices like smartphones and AR glasses. It's widely used in navigation, education, and marketing.
## Virtual Reality
VR immerses users in a fully digital environment, allowing them to explore virtual worlds and interact with digital objects through headsets. It's popular in gaming, training simulations, and therapeutic scenarios.
## Mixed Reality
MR combines elements of both AR and VR, integrating digital objects into the real world in a way that they can interact in real-time. It's used in education, healthcare, and manufacturing for more intuitive interactions and learning experiences.
